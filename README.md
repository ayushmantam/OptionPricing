 Option Pricing using Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis
 
 • Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Statsmodels, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
 
 • Developed and evaluated advanced machine learning and time series models (CNN-BiLSTM, AM + MLP, XGBoost,
 Neural Networks) for accurate option pricing.
 
 • Engineered 10+ technical indicators from NIFTY 50 OHLCV data, including rolling averages, momentum, and expiry
 timelines, achieving a 0.9995 R² score through correlation-based feature selection.
 
 • Preprocessed data with scaling, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and handling of missing values to ensure robust
 input quality.
 
 • Enhanced prediction accuracy using ensemble methods like weighted averaging and stacking with Ridge Regression.
 
 • Assessed model performance with standard regression metrics (RMSE, MAE) and visualized predicted vs. actual
 prices to validate results.
